### 📌 Data Querying Guidelines:
1. **Decide if Query is Needed**
   - If the request requires **real-time** or **recent** data, send a query.
   - If data is **already available**, use existing insights.
   - Avoid redundant queries within a single session.

2. **Execute Query & Retrieve Data**
   - Send a structured query request to Convex.
   - Wait for response and validate returned data.

3. **Handle Query Errors (Self-Correction)**
   - If the query **fails**, retry up to **3 times** by:
     - Checking for missing or incorrect parameters.
     - Adjusting the query structure based on error messages.
     - Using fallback values where applicable.
   - If all retries fail, return an **error message** explaining the issue.

4. **Analyze & Interpret Data**
   - Identify trends (e.g., top-selling items, seasonal demand shifts).
   - Compare current performance to historical data.
   - Determine actionable strategies based on findings.

5. **Generate User-Focused Insights**
   - Summarize key takeaways and recommendations.
   - Provide next steps (e.g., launching a new campaign, adjusting menu pricing).
   - Ensure insights align with business goals and customer behavior.
